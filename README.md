# MetaFarmerX
**NOTE:** Further Development of MetaFarmerX will be taken offline as delta neutral farming stratgies will be developed. You can reach me on Twitter for further inquiry: [@0xSamsar](https://twitter.com/0xSamsar)

## Introduction
MetaFarmerX is a distributed yield-farming framework that can be used to to simplify building and deploying automated yield farming strategies. This system can be used for data aggregation (on-chain & off-chain), trade execution, and strategy & portfolio management. The purpose of this repo is to provide a template - further implementation is needed to create a robust system.

## Setup
- Install python libraries
- Set & source environment variables
- Implement ```AutoHedger``` class
- Adapt MarketFeed to publish data formatted for your needs
